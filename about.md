Hi, my name is Konstantin Polyashenko and I am a software developer. My goto languages are Java and Ruby, but I am familiar with other technologies as well. I also write about things that interest me on this site, so make sure to check out my blog posts. Aside from my major projects I also work on random software projects, generally for hackathons. My resume is found

Feel free to send me your inquiries over emails.
