Write a function that takes an integer array as input and returns the highest possible product
that you can get from three of the integers.

Example:
{% highlight java %}
//given objects for each rectangle
//object arguments are (leftX, bottomY, width, height)
Rectangle firstRectangle = new Rectangle(1,1,3,1);
Rectangle secondRectangle = new Rectangle(2,1,1,2);

//result is a rectangle object
{% endhighlight %}

<img src="/img/2.png" style="width:250px;height:228px;">

Solution Overview:
Determine the X and Y sizes of the lines connected to the given (X,Y) point. Then
determine if the X lines overlap between the two rectangles. Do the same for the Y lines.
Finally simply multiply the X and Y overlap to determine the area of the overlap rectangles.
<br>
To determine the overlap of the two X lines determine the highest endpoint of the two lines. Then compare that value to smallest endpoint of the two X lines. If the lowest endpoint is larger than
the highest endpoint, then there is no overlap. Otherwise subtract the highest endpoint from the
lowest endpoint to get the overlap size.

<img src="/img/4.png" style="width:304px;height:90px;">
<br>
The same thing is done to get the overlap between the two Y lines.
